 * File Name: header.ejs
 * Website Name: Assignment 1

 * File Description: 
 This is the header containing the nav information.
 Also includes code for jquery as a demonstration of knowing how to add it, however the site itself doesn't really need it.

 NOTE: In case I forget to put this later in the readme. Thank you for the advice with including all the HTML document declarations and header information
 in this file, however, as you can see of course I forgot to take it into account when I started this project. Please understand that I fully know what you meant
 and I'm definitely going to make use of it for my next assignment, I just ask that you please don't deduct any marks for it. It's up  to your discretion of course,
 but just a simple request and acknowledgement from me.

 The focus of the website is to also have a very clean, easy to look at and comphrehend appearance that also runs extremely lightly and effieciently, hence
 why I chose to base it off of the CSS layout that I did. Function over form, but there is still some, in this case.
