# Assignment 1 Part 1

Hello, this is my submission for Part 1 of this assignment. I used Express to generate the templates along with the EJS engine and did everything else as required. Though I'm not too clear on what I should do for part two of the assignment. Will I need to re-generate it again, or simply build up on the website as it seems to be mostly the same. 

Thanks, Roman

# Assignment 1 Part 2

Thank you for the advice with including all the HTML document declarations and header information
in this file, however, as you can see of course I forgot to take it into account when I started this project.
Please understand that I fully know what you meant and I'm definitely going to make use of it for my next assignment, 
I just ask that you please don't deduct any marks for it. It's up  to your discretion of course, still! But moving on:

 The focus of the website is to also have a very clean, easy to look at and comphrehend appearance that also runs extremely lightly and
 effieciently, hence why I chose to base it off of the CSS layout that I did. Function over form, but there is still some, in this case.
 
 And with that said, everything should be working, documented and otherwise working as it should! Please let me know if there are any
 issues!
 
 Thanks, Roman
