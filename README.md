# Assignment 1 Part 1

Hello, this is my submission for Part 1 of this assignment. I used Express to generate the templates along with the EJS engine and did everything else as required. Though I'm not too clear on what I should do for part two of the assignment. Will I need to re-generate it again, or simply build up on the website as it seems to be mostly the same. 
Thanks, Roman
